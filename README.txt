I am testing out an idea for making a navbar appear at a given breakpoint

Once users scroll beyond the splash page the navbar fades in and pins to the top of the display.

The goal is to remove the distraction of the navbar when you first enter the page. Once the user has begun the navigation process then we reveal the landscape of the webpage.
